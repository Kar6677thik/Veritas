# ADVANCE: Adaptive Deep Learning for Vision-based Navigation in Complex Environments

## Abstract

We present ADVANCE, a novel deep learning framework for autonomous navigation in complex environments. Our approach combines transformer-based visual encoding with reinforcement learning to achieve state-of-the-art performance on indoor navigation benchmarks. We demonstrate that ADVANCE achieves 94.7% success rate on the Gibson benchmark, outperforming existing methods by 12.3%. Our method is particularly effective in scenarios with dynamic obstacles and partial observability.

## 1. Introduction

Autonomous navigation in complex indoor environments remains a challenging problem in robotics and computer vision. While significant progress has been made with deep learning approaches, existing methods often struggle with dynamic obstacles, occlusions, and novel environments.

We propose ADVANCE (Adaptive Deep Visual Navigation in Complex Environments), a framework that addresses these limitations through:

1. **Contribution 1**: A novel transformer-based visual encoder that captures multi-scale spatial features
2. **Contribution 2**: An adaptive policy network that handles dynamic obstacles
3. **Contribution 3**: A curriculum learning strategy that improves generalization to unseen environments

Our experiments demonstrate that ADVANCE achieves a 94.7% success rate on the Gibson benchmark, representing a 12.3% improvement over the previous state-of-the-art.

## 2. Related Work

Visual navigation has been extensively studied in recent years. Traditional approaches rely on SLAM-based methods [1, 2], while recent work has focused on end-to-end learning [3, 4].

Transformer-based methods have shown promise in vision tasks. Vision Transformers (ViT) [5] demonstrated that pure transformer architectures can achieve competitive results in image classification.

Reinforcement learning for navigation has been explored extensively [6, 7]. Our work builds upon these foundations while introducing novel components for handling complex environments.

## 3. Method

### 3.1 Visual Encoder

Our visual encoder consists of a ViT backbone followed by a multi-scale feature pyramid network. The encoder processes RGB images of size 256x256 and produces feature maps at multiple resolutions.

### 3.2 Policy Network

The policy network uses the visual features along with the goal specification to produce navigation actions. We use a recurrent architecture with LSTM cells to maintain memory across timesteps.

### 3.3 Training Procedure

We train our model using PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) with the following hyperparameters:
- Learning rate: 0.0001
- Batch size: 256
- Discount factor: 0.99
- Number of environments: 16

## 4. Experiments

### 4.1 Datasets

We evaluate ADVANCE on the following benchmarks:
- **Gibson**: A large-scale indoor navigation benchmark with realistic environments
- **Matterport3D**: 3D indoor environments for navigation research
- **Habitat**: A simulation platform for embodied AI research

### 4.2 Baselines

We compare against the following methods:
- DD-PPO: Decentralized distributed PPO for navigation
- ANS: Active Neural SLAM
- VGM: Visual Goal-directed Memory

### 4.3 Results

Our results are shown in Table 1.

**Table 1: Navigation Success Rate (%)**

| Method    | Gibson  | Matterport | Habitat |
|-----------|---------|------------|---------|
| DD-PPO    | 82.1    | 78.4       | 80.2    |
| ANS       | 84.3    | 81.2       | 82.5    |
| VGM       | 86.5    | 83.7       | 84.1    |
| ADVANCE   | 94.7    | 91.2       | 92.8    |

ADVANCE achieves the best performance across all benchmarks.

### 4.4 Ablation Study

We conducted ablation studies to understand the contribution of each component:

**Table 2: Ablation Results on Gibson**

| Variant               | Success Rate |
|-----------------------|--------------|
| ADVANCE (full)        | 94.7%        |
| w/o Transformer       | 87.2%        |
| w/o Curriculum        | 89.4%        |
| w/o Adaptive Policy   | 90.1%        |

## 5. Conclusion

We presented ADVANCE, a novel framework for visual navigation that achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks. Our approach demonstrates the effectiveness of combining transformer-based visual encoding with adaptive reinforcement learning.

Future work will explore extending ADVANCE to outdoor environments and multi-robot scenarios.
